## Background

We want to help you build better gov APIs.  Our two GSA programs - ([18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) and [DigitalGov User Experience Program] (https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/digitalgov-user-experience-program/) - created this page to give you the tools for a better API User Experience. We took the format we use and laid it out for you to copy (or fork, as it were). 

connect you to customers, developers and User Experience experts to help reduce errors, simplify work-flow and increase customer use of your API.



### Goals (Gray - is this our goals or goals of this kit?)

* Improve UX of government APIs 
* Create a process for improving APIs in the future
* Expand GSA's Usability Services into new area
