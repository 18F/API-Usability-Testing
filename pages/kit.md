## API Usability Kit

We created this page to give you the tools for a better API User Experience. We took the format we've used to evaluate more than a dozen gov APIs and laid it out for you to copy (or fork, as it were). The kit provides a structured way to collect feedback from real or representative customers, and tools to collect this data and act on it.

The format is simple: 

1. Invite developers to look at your API.
2. Listen to them critique it and perhaps try to use it
3. Ask them questions
4. Fix key issues
5. Repeat
