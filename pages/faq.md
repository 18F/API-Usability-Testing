### 1. Where should we find developers to participate in usability sessions for our APIs?
  
The best source for useful feedback of your API program is from developers who already use your APIs.  It's best if you have already been engaging with your developer community so that you have some names in mind to ask to participate. However, if you don't know who your users are, one option is to put up a notice on your developer hub that solicits volunteers.  Like this (GRAY - can we put an example or a screenshot?)
  
Alternatively, you can engage with the developer community in your area and ask for volunteers there.  For instance, in DC, there is a vibrant [API meetup](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Web-API-User-Group/) that would be good to visit in search of participants.  Or use Twitter, listserves or social networks.

Lastly, you can contact the [API Usability team at GSA](http://18f.github.io/API-Usability-Testing/pages/contact_us.html) to ask for suggestions.   


### 2. How can we do API usability testing with a remote participant?  

Ideally, you'll have your test participants (e.g. the developers) in the same room with your team. If you can't make that happen, use any webinar software and have the developer review the site remotely while you watch. Feel free to record that webinar so you can review it later.

### 3. Do we need to pay them?

Try and rely on people's goodwill and their interest in helping to improve the federal govennment. People like to help and offer their expertise. That should work 95% of the time.

### 4. How many developers should we get?

We use 3-5 developers per session and can get a ton of data from them.
