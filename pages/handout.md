API Usability Review @ {Agency}
{Names of Organizers}

Welcome to our API Usability Review. We’re very excited to be able to have you here to help make government APIs better.

Today, we'll be reviewing the API programs of {Agency}. Three private industry developers have agreed to walk through the developer experience to . Our schedule will be:

* 9:00 - 9:40:  Expert 1 (Name/Organization) reviews each API for 10 min. 5 things to be fixed and Q+A
* 9:40 - 9:45: Break
* 9:45 - 10:25:   Expert 2 (Name/Organization) review session.  5 things to be fixed and Q+A
* 10:25 - 10:30: Break
* 10:30 - 11:10:  Expert 3 (Name/Organization) review session.  5 things to be fixed and Q+A
* 11:10 - 11:15: Break
* 11:15 - 12:00:  API owners discuss, provide peer review, and share concrete next steps they will adopt.


These reviews will begin at the developer hub level. Then, as time permits, they will drill down to one or more individual API pages. Our reviewers will provide feedback on the following:

* What is good?
* What is bad?
* What is missing?
* What would you do differently?
* What APIs would you like to have from them that aren’t there?
* What tools or resources would you like to have that you don’t see?
