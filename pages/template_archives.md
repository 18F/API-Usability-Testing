## Email to Agency Participants - One Week Before  (1st session)

Hi folks,  

We're looking forward to having *[Agency Name]* involved on Monday and wanted to share a bit of quick background.  One thing to note is that this is very much a prototype event.  We're trying something new here, so as we go through this, please feel free to suggest improvements to the process as well.  Most of all though, we want to give you a healthy swath of fresh outside feedback and developer insight.  

We're going to be in Room 1101 at GSA HQ *[link address]* and will be going from 9am-12pm, so please plan to arrive before 9 so we can start on time.  At security, you can skip the metal detectors and show their your government ID to get in.  If you have any trouble, have them call my cell (below).  The schedule is below and we'll look to hold tightly to it.  

* 9:00-9:30:  Expert 1 (First Developer's Name) review session.
* 9:30-10:00:   Expert 2 (Second Developer's Name) review session.
* 10:00-10:30:  Expert 3 (Third Developer's Name) review session.
* 10:30-11:00:  Expert 4 (Fourth Developer's Name) review session. 
* 11:00-12:00:  API owners discuss, provide peer review, and share concrete next next steps they will adopt.

Each of these four developers are familiar with the government space and have built mashups consuming government APIs before.  Each developer will be coming to GSA (or connecting remotely in XX's case [he's in CA]) for 30 minutes and in that time, will go through each of the agencies for 6-7 minutes.  Each agency might receive feedback at three levels - the developer hub, individual API documentation, and the API endpoint itself.   We'll be encouraging them to speak aloud as they navigate your developer resources so that you can have plenty of unpackaged feedback.  

Each reviewer is advanced enough not to need further direction and I'll actually be asking agencies to just observe so that we can best replicate what outside developers experience.  Also, with such short timeframes, we only have time for the reviewer to give their input, so please make sure to let them speak.  If they ask a question, you can answer it but please be very brief.  I'll lovingly be encouraging reviewers and agencies both to stay on track.  :)

I'm assuming you'd like to focus on the NBM APIs but if you desire feedback on a particular API or developer resource, let me know and I'll ask them to prioritize that but otherwise, they'll be encouraged to give feedback on whatever is catching their attention.  

I'm really looking forward to this and want to thank you again for being an early adopter.  I'm hoping that the feedback that each of the agencies is getting will be of use to you and your team and we're definitely glad that you'll be representing.  

Please reach out any time with questions and feel free to call me over the weekend at *[Your Number]*.  

Thanks.

Developer prompt.  

Pull up agency developer hub and look at it from the perspective of a potential developer.  Begin at the developer hub level, then - as time permits, drill down to one or more individual API pages, and, as you see fit, possibly the actual endpoint and call returns themselves.  

* Feedback
 * What is good?
 * What is bad?
 * What is missing?
 * What would you do differently?
* Ideas
 * What APIs would you like to have from them that aren’t there?
 * What tools or resources would you like to have that you don’t see?


## Email to Outside Experts - One Week Before  (1st session)

Hey folks!  

Thank you again; we're really looking forward to having your insight on *[day of the week]*.  A bit of quick background:   One thing to note is that this is very much a prototype event.  We're trying something new here, so as we go through this, please feel free to suggest improvements to the process as well.  The goals are to maximize your opportunities to give feedback and suggestions to these four agencies.  

We're going to be in Room 1101 at GSA HQ *[Link address]*.  The schedule is below and we'll look to hold tightly to it.  

* 9:00-9:30:  Expert 1 (First Developer's Name) review session - in person
* 9:30-10:00:   Expert 2 (SecondDeveloper's Name) review session - in person
* 10:00-10:30:  Expert 3 (Third Developer's Name) review session - in person.
* 10:30-11:00:  Expert 4 (Fourth Developer's Name) review session - remote. 
* 11:00-12:00:  API owners discuss, provide peer review, and share concrete next next steps they will adopt.

We have four teams who will be in the room, each reasonably mature so please feel free to give them solid and straightforward feedback.  The agencies: *[List agencies, linking to the developer hub each time]*.  Please plan to arrive (or dial in) 10 minutes before your session is scheduled, so you can go through security.  Call as  you arrive and we can meet you on the other side of security and escort you up.  

Your session is 30 minutes, allowing 6-7 minutes of feedback for each agency.  There are three levels of potential feedback, along the lines of the prompts below,  I'm including links for the areas of focus but you should feel free to give any and all feedback that you see fit.  In fact, we'd like you to keep up whatever stream of consciousness you're willing to, in order to offer more raw perspective and to share an outsider's perspective.  With such short timeframes, I've told the agencies that we only have time for the you to give their input, so to observe only.  If you have a question, they're to keep it brief, but feel free to ask whatever you need to in order to give them the best feedback you can.  

I'm really looking forward to this and want to thank you again for being an early adopter. An outline of potential feedback is below as well as links for Monday.  We'll have a  laptop with chrome for you to use to drive, so you only need to  bring yourself.  

Please reach out any time with questions and feel free to call me over the weekend at *[your number]*.  

Thanks.

p.s.  Please also note that all of this feedback is off of the record and solely intended for constructive feedback, so you should speak your mind and not hold any punches.  :)
