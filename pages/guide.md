Here's how to create your own API Usability Evaluation:


First, **sell this concept to your team**. You're going to be spending some time getting this together, so let's make it count. Do people understand why User Experience is important? Are they willing to make changes based on the feedback you get? Get people on board, and get them excited about the evaluation.

Then **find some reviwers**. 

find some reviewers

4 weeks - Invite partipants
3 weeks - Reserve room, webinar, etc.
2 weeks - Ensure everyone is confirmed.
1 week - Send confirmation emails with details
1 day - 'See you tomorrow' email to all
+1 day - Thank you emails to developers, 'any suggestions on how we can facilitate'.
+1 day - Check-In Email to agencies, include survey, say that we'd love to check in in 2 weeks.
+2 weeks - Check in with agencies on improvements made?



Find some reviewers - You have more fans than you realize. FInd them by doing XXXXX
