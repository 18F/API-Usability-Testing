/Developer Program
=============

This is the [official microsite of the API Usability Program](http://18f.github.io/API-Usability-Testing/), which provides workshops and a toolkit for agencies to collect feedback about their APIs from real or representatitve customers, and then gives agencies the tools to act on the collected data.

The site contains information about API Usability Testing sessions, the API Testing Kit, and details the lessons we've learned from analyzing dozens of agency APIs.

About the Site
