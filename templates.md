## Email Invitation to Agencies to Participate

We're been putting together a pilot project that combines usability testing and APIs and are scheduling a session on March 4.  For this, we are looking for three agencies who have multiple APIs and who would like to get feedback on them and their developer resources from three outside experts.  The event would be from 9-12, with time at the end for the three agencies to compare notes and ideas with each other, too.  Each agency could send one person or bring their whole team.  I think your operation would find this substantial and enriching.  Any interest in this?  


## Email Invitation to an Outside Developer to Participate


Hey,  

We're prototyping a form of API feedback later this month and I wanted to see if you were free to join in.  

Here's what it'd be like - We take three agencies who have at least a few APIs and over the course of a morning, ask three outside developers to give them feedback.  We'd schedule it such that we'd only need an hour of your time and the attention would be entirely on what you had to say.   Thoughout your session, we'd have lined up for you the developer hubs of each of the three agencies and would ask you to go through each, spending 10-12 minutes per agency, giving general or specific feedback, sharing what you would change, what you find helpful, and what you find inconvenient or confusing.  The agency's API producers would be present but would be there solely to hear your thoughts.  If there was time or if it'd be helpful, we'd have prompts on hand to ask you to walk through a workflow and respond specifically to it, though you could also just preach truth to the agencies the entire time instead.  :)  We have a number of agencies who are eager to engage and hear your thoughts - so many that we have a full waiting list.  

A few notes -
* I'm coordinating this event and would assure that it is set up to be an efficient use of your time.  
* After each of the outside experts have given their feedback, we will have a followup discussion where agencies share with each other what they learned and what they would suggest for each other.  During this, I'll be requesting each agency to choose 2 short- and 2 medium-term changes that they plan to implement as a result of this feedback so you can be sure that your feedback is going to good use.  
* You could do this in person here at GSA or over Google Hangout from your office.  

Our next session is from 9-12 on [insert date], but we'd only need you for one hour in that time.  This should be a great opportunity to rub off on some of the agencies who are best in a position to do justice to your feedback.  Would you be game?  




## Email to Agency Participants - One Week Before  (1st session)

Hi folks,  

We're looking forward to having *[Agency Name]* involved on Monday and wanted to share a bit of quick background.  One thing to note is that this is very much a prototype event.  We're trying something new here, so as we go through this, please feel free to suggest improvements to the process as well.  Most of all though, we want to give you a healthy swath of fresh outside feedback and developer insight.  

We're going to be in Room 1101 at GSA HQ *[link address]* and will be going from 9am-12pm, so please plan to arrive before 9 so we can start on time.  At security, you can skip the metal detectors and show their your government ID to get in.  If you have any trouble, have them call my cell (below).  The schedule is below and we'll look to hold tightly to it.  

* 9:00-9:30:  Expert 1 (First Developer's Name) review session.
* 9:30-10:00:   Expert 2 (Second Developer's Name) review session.
* 10:00-10:30:  Expert 3 (Third Developer's Name) review session.
* 10:30-11:00:  Expert 4 (Fourth Developer's Name) review session. 
* 11:00-12:00:  API owners discuss, provide peer review, and share concrete next next steps they will adopt.

Each of these four developers are familiar with the government space and have built mashups consuming government APIs before.  Each developer will be coming to GSA (or connecting remotely in XX's case [he's in CA]) for 30 minutes and in that time, will go through each of the agencies for 6-7 minutes.  For each agency, there are three levels at which they may give feedback, along the lines of the below.  We'll be encouraging them to speak aloud as they navigate your developer resources so that you can have plenty of unpackaged feedback.  

Each reviewer is advanced enough not to need further direction and I'll actually be asking agencies to just observe so that we can best replicate what outside developers experience.  Also, with such short timeframes, we only have time for the reviewer to give their input, so please make sure to let them speak.  If they ask a question, you can answer it but please be very brief.  I'll lovingly be encouraging reviewers and agencies both to stay on track.  :)

I'm assuming you'd like to focus on the NBM APIs but if you desire feedback on a particular API or developer resource, let me know and I'll ask them to prioritize that but otherwise, they'll be encouraged to give feedback on whatever is catching their attention.  

I'm really looking forward to this and want to thank you again for being an early adopter.  I'm hoping that the feedback that each of the agencies is getting will be of use to you and your team and we're definitely glad that you'll be representing.  

Please reach out any time with questions and feel free to call me over the weekend at *[Your Number]*.  

Thanks.

## Email to Agency Participants - One Week Before  (1st session)

Hey folks!  

Thank you again; we're really looking forward to having your insight on Monday.  A bit of quick background:   One thing to note is that this is very much a prototype event.  We're trying something new here, so as we go through this, please feel free to suggest improvements to the process as well.  The goals are to maximize your opportunities to give feedback and suggestions to these four agencies, .  

We're going to be in Room 1101 at GSA HQ *[Link address]*.  The schedule is below and we'll look to hold tightly to it.  

* 9:00-9:30:  Expert 1 (First Developer's Name) review session - in person
* 9:30-10:00:   Expert 2 (SecondDeveloper's Name) review session - in person
* 10:00-10:30:  Expert 3 (Third Developer's Name) review session - in person.
* 10:30-11:00:  Expert 4 (Fourth Developer's Name) review session - remote. 
* 11:00-12:00:  API owners discuss, provide peer review, and share concrete next next steps they will adopt.

We have four teams who will be in the room, each reasonably mature so please feel free to give them solid and straightforward feedback.  The agencies: *[List agencies, linking to the developer hub each time]*.  Please plan to arrive (or dial in) 10 minutes before your session is scheduled, so you can go through security.  Call as  you arrive and we can meet you on the other side of security and escort you up.  

Your session is 30 minutes, allowing 6-7 minutes of feedback for each agency.  There are three levels of potential feedback, along the lines of the prompts below,  I'm including links for the areas of focus but you should feel free to give any and all feedback that you see fit.  In fact, we'd like you to keep up whatever stream of consciousness you're willing to, in order to offer more raw perspective and to share an outsider's perspective.  With such short timeframes, I've told the agencies that we only have time for the you to give their input, so to observe only.  If you have a question, they're to keep it brief, but feel free to ask whatever you need to in order to give them the best feedback you can.  

I'm really looking forward to this and want to thank you again for being an early adopter. An outline of potential feedback is below as well as links for Monday.  We'll have a  laptop with chrome for you to use to drive, so you only need to  bring yourself.  

Please reach out any time with questions and feel free to call me over the weekend at *[your number]*.  

Thanks.

p.s.  Please also note that all of this feedback is off of the record and solely intended for constructive feedback, so you should speak your mind and not hold any punches.  :)

 Hi folks,  

We're really looking forward the upcoming feedback sessions this Thursday.   We're going to be in Room 1101 at GSA HQ and will be going from 9am-12pm, so please plan to arrive before 9 so we can start on time. At security, you can skip the metal detectors and show them your government ID to get in.  If you have any trouble, have them call my cell (below). 

The schedule is below and we'll look to hold tightly to it.  We've got a great lineup of developers, though, and we think that you'll find this really useful.  

*Most of all, we want to give you a healthy swath of fresh outside feedback and developer insight.*


* 9:00-9:45:  Expert 1 (First Developer's Name (and affiliation)) review session 
* 9:45-10:30:   Expert 2 (Second Developer's Name (and affiliation)) review session 
* 10:30-11:15:  Expert 3 (Third Developer's Name (and affiliation)) review session 
* 11:15-12:00:  API owners discuss, provide peer review, and share concrete next next steps they will adopt.

Each of these three developers are familiar with the government space and have built mashups consuming APIs before.  Each developer will connecting remotely for a session of 45 minutes and in that time, will go through each of the agencies for about 10 minutes and then engage in Q&A for the last part.  For each agency, there are three levels at which they may give feedback, along the lines of the below.  We'll be encouraging them to speak aloud as they navigate your developer resources so that you can have plenty of unpackaged feedback.  

Each reviewer is advanced enough not to need further direction and I'd ask you to mostly just observe so that we can best replicate what outside developers experience.
